# Type Check Fix Verification

## Issue
```
contexts/GridContext.tsx(80,11): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'setGridOtpSession'.
```

## Root Cause
During the refactor to remove `gridOtpSession` from GridContext state, one reference to `setGridOtpSession(null)` was left in the logout handler on line 80.

## Fix Applied
Removed the stray `setGridOtpSession(null)` call from the logout handler in GridContext.tsx.

### Before:
```typescript
if (isLoggingOut) {
  setGridAccount(null);
  setSolanaAddress(null);
  setGridAccountStatus('not_created');
  setGridAccountId(null);
  setGridOtpSession(null); // ❌ ERROR: This state no longer exists
  // ...
}
```

### After:
```typescript
if (isLoggingOut) {
  setGridAccount(null);
  setSolanaAddress(null);
  setGridAccountStatus('not_created');
  setGridAccountId(null);
  // ✅ setGridOtpSession removed - state no longer exists
  // ...
}
```

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ State Variable Completely Removed
- [x] No `useState` for gridOtpSession
- [x] No `setGridOtpSession` calls
- [x] No `gridOtpSession` in GridContext interface
- [x] No `gridOtpSession` in provider value

### ✅ Storage Management Still Works
- [x] OTP session written to storage by `initiateGridSignIn()`
- [x] OTP session cleared from storage by `completeGridSignIn()`
- [x] OTP session cleared from storage on logout
- [x] Comments updated to reflect storage-only approach

### ✅ Type Safety
- [x] No TypeScript errors in GridContext.tsx
- [x] No TypeScript errors in verify-otp.tsx
- [x] No TypeScript errors in test files
- [x] All imports correct

### ✅ Tests Updated
- [x] Unit tests don't use `mock()` function
- [x] Integration tests don't use `mock()` function
- [x] All test assertions updated
- [x] Call tracking uses plain arrays

## Files Changed

1. **apps/client/contexts/GridContext.tsx** - Removed `setGridOtpSession(null)` call
2. **apps/client/__tests__/unit/VerifyOtpScreen.test.tsx** - Fixed mock functions
3. **apps/client/__tests__/integration/otp-screen-grid-integration.test.ts** - Fixed imports
