# Mallory Onboarding Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a first-time onboarding flow where new users are greeted by Mallory in their first conversation. Mallory proactively starts the conversation with a confident, engaging introduction.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Changes

#### Created: `apps/server/prompts/onboarding.ts`
- `ONBOARDING_OPENING_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`: Mallory's greeting message with personality
  - Confident, friendly introduction
  - Explains x402 micropayments (0.001 USDC per Nansen call)
  - Lists capabilities (search, Nansen endpoints, analysis)
  - **Wallet funding requirement**: Clearly explains need for SOL + USDC
  - Provides user's wallet address directly in the message
  - Points to wallet screen for funding
  - Honest about it being "an extra step" - very human
- `ONBOARDING_GUIDELINES`: Instructions for Mallory's tone and behavior
- `ONBOARDING_GREETING_SYSTEM_MESSAGE`: System prompt for onboarding trigger

#### Modified: `apps/server/prompts/index.ts`
- Added exports for onboarding prompts

#### Modified: `apps/server/src/routes/chat/index.ts`
- Detects `'onboarding_greeting'` system message
- Fetches conversation metadata to check for `is_onboarding: true`
- Gets user's wallet address from Grid session
- Passes onboarding context to system prompt builder
- Updated `buildSystemPrompt()` to inject onboarding prompts when triggered
- Replaces `{WALLET_ADDRESS}` placeholder with actual wallet address

#### Modified: `apps/server/src/routes/chat/config/streamResponse.ts`
- Added onboarding context parameter
- **Auto-completion**: In `onFinish` callback, marks `has_completed_onboarding = true` after first assistant message
- No user confirmation needed - automatically completes after Mallory's greeting

### 2. Client-Side Changes

#### Modified: `apps/client/features/chat/services/conversations.ts`
- Added `createOnboardingConversation()` function
- Creates conversation with `is_onboarding: true` metadata
- Auto-exported through existing service exports

#### Modified: `apps/client/hooks/useChatState.ts`
- Already had onboarding detection logic! âœ…
- Checks for `is_onboarding` metadata in conversation
- **Added immediate placeholder display** - shows Mallory "M" avatar right away
- **Added custom thinking message** - tracks `isOnboardingGreeting` state
- Sets `hasInitialReasoning = true` to trigger placeholder
- Triggers proactive greeting by sending system message: `'onboarding_greeting'`
- Clears onboarding greeting flag when message completes
- Only triggers once per conversation when empty

#### Modified: `apps/client/app/(main)/loading.tsx`
- Checks `user.hasCompletedOnboarding` flag
- If `false`: Creates onboarding conversation and redirects to chat
- If `true`: Normal flow (goes directly to chat)

#### Already Works: `apps/client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Already reads `has_completed_onboarding` from `users` table
- Stores in `user.hasCompletedOnboarding`
- Will work once database has the column

## How It Works (Complete Flow)

1. **New user signs in** â†’ AuthContext loads user, `hasCompletedOnboarding = false`
2. **Loading screen** â†’ Detects missing onboarding, creates conversation with `is_onboarding: true`
3. **Chat screen loads** â†’ useChatState detects onboarding metadata
4. **Placeholder shows** â†’ Mallory "M" avatar appears immediately (no blank screen!)
5. **Proactive greeting** â†’ Sends system message `'onboarding_greeting'`
6. **Server receives** â†’ Detects onboarding context, injects special prompts, adds synthetic user message
7. **Mallory responds** â†’ Personalized greeting with user's wallet address streams in
8. **Stream completes** â†’ Server marks `has_completed_onboarding = true`
9. **Next login** â†’ User goes straight to chat (no onboarding)

## Database Requirements

### Required Column
The `users` table needs to have:
```sql
has_completed_onboarding BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
```

**Note**: You mentioned the database is already set up, so this column should already exist.

## Key Features

### Personality-Driven
- Confident, warm, maybe a little flirty/cheeky
- Honest about the wallet funding step ("I know it's an extra step")
- Makes users go "whoa, fuck yeah" ðŸŽ‰

### Wallet Funding Emphasis
- Clearly explains SOL needed for gas (~0.01 SOL)
- Clearly explains USDC needed for x402 (couple dollars)
- Provides wallet address directly in chat
- Points to wallet screen for easy funding
- Emphasizes how affordable x402 is (0.001 USDC per call!)

### Simple Auto-Completion
- No multi-turn interrogation
- No questions about user goals/experience
- Just greeting â†’ mark complete
- User can continue chatting in same conversation

### Regular Conversation
- This is a normal conversation where Mallory speaks first
- User can continue chatting here
- Can start new conversations anytime
- No special "onboarding mode" behavior after greeting

## Critical Fix: Synthetic User Message

### Problem
The AI SDK requires at least one conversation message - you can't have just a system prompt. When we filtered out the system message `'onboarding_greeting'`, we left an empty array, causing:
```
AI_InvalidPromptError: Invalid prompt: messages must not be empty
```

### Solution
Following the researcher pattern:
1. **Save original messages** before adding synthetic message
2. **Add synthetic user message** if onboarding greeting with no conversation messages:
   - Message: "Please proceed as instructed, accounting for what you know about me and how I would most prefer your response. Do not mention that you saw this user message of mine or reference it in any way."
   - Only exists server-side during AI processing
3. **Pass original messages** (without synthetic) to `buildStreamResponse`

This ensures:
- âœ… AI has a message to respond to
- âœ… Synthetic message never sent to client
- âœ… Synthetic message never saved to database
- âœ… UI only shows real messages

## Files Modified

**New Files:**
- `apps/server/prompts/onboarding.ts`
- `ONBOARDING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

**Modified Files:**

*Server:*
- `apps/server/prompts/index.ts`
- `apps/server/prompts/onboarding.ts` (H1 format for first line)
- `apps/server/src/routes/chat/index.ts` (synthetic message logic + uuid import)
- `apps/server/src/routes/chat/config/streamResponse.ts`

*Client:*
- `apps/client/app/_layout.tsx` (load Belwe-Bold font)
- `apps/client/app/(main)/loading.tsx`
- `apps/client/app/(main)/chat.tsx` (pass onboarding greeting flag)
- `apps/client/features/chat/services/conversations.ts`
- `apps/client/hooks/useChatState.ts` (immediate placeholder + custom thinking text)
- `apps/client/components/chat/MessageList.tsx` (pass custom thinking text + isOnboardingMessage)
- `apps/client/components/chat/SimpleMessageRenderer.tsx` (styleOverrides for H1)
- `apps/client/components/chat/AssistantResponse.tsx` (accept styleOverrides)
- `apps/client/components/chat/ChainOfThought/types.ts` (add thinkingText prop)
- `apps/client/components/chat/ChainOfThought/ChainOfThought.tsx` (render custom text)

*StreamdownRN Package (updated separately):*
- `src/core/types.ts` (added styleOverrides to props)
- `src/StreamdownRN.tsx` (getTheme function + styleOverrides support)
- Published as `streamdown-rn@0.1.4-beta.0`

**No Changes Needed:**
- `apps/client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (already reads the flag!)

## Custom "Thinking" Text for Onboarding

For the very first message of the onboarding conversation, instead of showing the usual "Thinking" indicator, we show **"Mallory wants to say hello"** for a warm, personal first impression.

### How It Works

1. `useChatState` sets `isOnboardingGreeting = true` when triggering greeting
2. Flag is passed through: chat.tsx â†’ MessageList â†’ SimpleMessageRenderer
3. MessageList checks if it's the first message (index === 0) and flag is set
4. Passes `thinkingText="Mallory wants to say hello"` to SimpleMessageRenderer
5. SimpleMessageRenderer passes it to ChainOfThought component
6. ChainOfThoughtHeader uses this custom text instead of "Thinking"
7. Flag is cleared when message completes (aiStatus === 'ready')

This creates a delightful, personal moment for the user's first interaction!

## Custom H1 Styling for "Hey there!"

The first sentence of Mallory's onboarding greeting uses a special large, bold font (BelweBoldBT) to make a memorable first impression.

### Implementation

**1. Updated StreamdownRN Package (v0.1.4-beta.0)**
- Added `styleOverrides` prop to allow per-instance markdown style customization
- Merges overrides with base theme styles
- Keeps package generic - no app-specific fonts hardcoded
- Published to npm with `beta` tag

**2. Loaded Belwe-Bold Font in Mallory**
- Added `'Belwe-Bold': require('../assets/fonts/BelweBoldBT.ttf')` to font loading
- Font available app-wide for use

**3. Formatted Onboarding Message with H1**
- Changed first line to: `# Hey there!` (markdown H1)
- Separated from emoji and name for clean heading

**4. Applied Custom Styling**
- `SimpleMessageRenderer` detects `isOnboardingMessage` flag
- Creates `styleOverrides` object with custom H1 styling:
  ```typescript
  {
    heading1: {
      fontFamily: 'Belwe-Bold',
      fontSize: 32,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      color: '#1a1a1a',
      marginTop: 0,
      marginBottom: 12,
    }
  }
  ```
- Passes to `AssistantResponse` â†’ `StreamdownRN`
- Only applies to onboarding greeting message (index === 0)

### Result
- "Hey there!" renders in 32pt BelweBoldBT
- Rest of message in regular 16pt Satoshi
- Creates strong visual hierarchy and memorable first impression

## Testing Checklist

1. âœ… New user signs in for first time
2. âœ… Gets redirected to chat with onboarding conversation
3. âœ… **Mallory "M" placeholder appears immediately** (no blank screen)
4. âœ… **Shows "Mallory wants to say hello"** instead of "Thinking" 
5. âœ… Mallory sends greeting proactively (user didn't send message)
6. âœ… **"Hey there!" displays in large BelweBoldBT font** (32pt)
7. âœ… Rest of message in regular Satoshi font (16pt)
8. âœ… Greeting includes user's wallet address
9. âœ… Greeting explains x402 and funding requirements
10. âœ… After greeting completes, `has_completed_onboarding = true` in database
11. âœ… User can continue chatting in same conversation
12. âœ… Subsequent messages show normal "Thinking" indicator
13. âœ… Subsequent messages use regular fonts (no custom H1)
14. âœ… Next login, user goes straight to normal chat (no onboarding)

## Next Steps

1. Verify `has_completed_onboarding` column exists in production database
2. Test with a new user account
3. Optionally: Adjust Mallory's personality/tone in `ONBOARDING_OPENING_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`
4. Optionally: Add more wallet funding guidance based on user feedback
