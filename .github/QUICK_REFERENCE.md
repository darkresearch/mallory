# Quick Reference: CI/CD Testing

## 🚦 When Tests Run

| Event | Runs? | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Draft PR created | ⏭️  No | Saves CI minutes |
| Draft PR updated | ⏭️  No | Work freely in draft |
| PR marked "Ready for review" | ✅ Yes | Full test suite runs |
| Ready PR synchronized | ✅ Yes | Tests run on each commit |
| Push to `main` | ✅ Yes | Always protect main |
| Manual trigger | ✅ Yes | Via GitHub Actions UI |
| Push to other branches | ⏭️  No | Unless part of ready PR |

## 📊 Test Execution Flow

```
1. check-pr-state (1s)
   └─ Skip if draft PR
   
2. unit-tests (5s)
   ├─ No secrets needed
   ├─ Fully isolated
   └─ Fail fast if broken
   
3. integration-tests (30s)
   ├─ Real Supabase + Grid
   ├─ Needs secrets
   └─ Waits for unit tests
   
4. e2e-tests (2min)
   ├─ Starts backend server
   ├─ Full user flows
   ├─ OTP persistence
   └─ Waits for integration tests
   
5. test-summary
   └─ Reports overall status
```

**Total: ~2-3 minutes**

## 🔐 Required Secrets (7 total)

### Supabase (3 secrets)
```
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

### Test Account (2 secrets)
```
TEST_SUPABASE_EMAIL
TEST_SUPABASE_PASSWORD
```

### Mailosaur for OTP (2 secrets)
```
MAILOSAUR_API_KEY
MAILOSAUR_SERVER_ID
```

### Grid (1 secret - SERVER ONLY)
```
GRID_API_KEY
```

## 🎯 Cost Estimate

- **Per run:** ~$0.02
- **100 runs/month:** ~$2
- **Very affordable!**

## 🚀 Setup Steps

1. **Add secrets to GitHub**
   ```
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   → New repository secret
   ```

2. **Push workflow file**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/test.yml
   git commit -m "Add comprehensive CI/CD testing"
   git push
   ```

3. **Test it**
   - Create a draft PR → Should skip tests ✅
   - Mark PR as ready → Should run tests ✅
   - Check Actions tab for results

4. **Optional: Add status badge**
   ```markdown
   ![Tests](https://github.com/darkresearch/mallory/workflows/Comprehensive%20Tests/badge.svg)
   ```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Tests fail in CI but pass locally?

1. Check server logs artifact
2. Verify all secrets are set
3. Look at specific job logs
4. Check backend startup logs

### Backend won't start in CI?

1. Check `GRID_API_KEY` is set
2. Review `server-logs` artifact
3. Verify Supabase secrets are correct
4. Increase timeout if needed

### Integration tests timeout?

1. Check Mailosaur is accessible
2. Verify test account exists
3. Test account may need Grid re-setup
4. Check Supabase RLS policies

## 📈 Monitoring

### What to watch:
- Success rate (should be >95%)
- Run time (should be <3 min)
- Cost (should be <$5/month)
- Flaky tests (mark and fix)

## ✅ Validation Checklist
