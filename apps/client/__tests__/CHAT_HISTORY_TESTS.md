# Chat History Tests - Comprehensive Test Suite

This document describes the comprehensive test suite created for chat history functionality, covering all edge cases and user journeys.

## Test Coverage Overview

### ✅ Unit Tests (`__tests__/unit/chatHistory.test.ts`)
- **Function signatures and error handling**
- **Edge case inputs** (empty strings, null, special characters, long IDs)
- **Concurrent access patterns**
- **Type safety verification**

### ✅ Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/chat-history-loading.test.ts`)
- **Message loading** with real Supabase
  - Empty conversations
  - Multiple messages
  - Message ordering (oldest first)
  - Messages with reasoning parts
  - Messages with tool calls
- **Conversation loading**
  - Loading from storage
  - Loading most recent conversation
  - Creating new conversations
- **Edge cases**
  - Non-existent conversations
  - Missing metadata
  - Very long conversation history (100+ messages)
  - Concurrent loads
  - Special characters and emojis
- **Real-time updates**
  - Loading new messages after initial load

### ✅ E2E Tests (`__tests__/e2e/chat-history-journey.test.ts`)
- **Complete user journeys**
  - Opening chat history → viewing conversations → opening conversation
  - Searching conversations → finding matching results
  - Opening conversation from history → messages load correctly
  - Creating new chat → appears in history → can open it
  - Large conversation history (20+ conversations) → loads efficiently
  - Real-time updates when new message arrives

## Edge Cases Covered

### Loading & Persistence
- ✅ Empty conversation history
- ✅ Non-existent conversation IDs
- ✅ Very long conversation IDs (1000+ chars)
- ✅ Special characters in conversation IDs
- ✅ UUID format conversation IDs
- ✅ Null/undefined conversation IDs
- ✅ Concurrent loads for same conversation
- ✅ Database errors during load
- ✅ Missing message metadata
- ✅ Messages with empty content
- ✅ Very long conversation history (100+ messages)

### Message Handling
- ✅ Messages with reasoning parts
- ✅ Messages with tool calls
- ✅ Messages with missing metadata
- ✅ Messages with special characters and emojis
- ✅ Message ordering (oldest first)
- ✅ Preserving isLiked/isDisliked flags
- ✅ Reconstructing messages from content when parts missing

### Conversation Management
- ✅ Loading from secure storage
- ✅ Loading most recent conversation
- ✅ Creating new conversation when none exists
- ✅ Multiple conversations for same user
- ✅ Conversation metadata handling
- ✅ Active conversation tracking

### Real-time Updates
- ✅ Loading new messages after initial load
- ✅ Real-time message insertion
- ✅ Real-time conversation updates

### Search Functionality
- ✅ Searching conversations by message content
- ✅ Finding matching conversations
- ✅ Search with special characters
- ✅ Empty search results

### Performance
- ✅ Loading many conversations efficiently
- ✅ Concurrent loads
- ✅ Large conversation histories

## Running Tests

### Run All Chat History Tests
```bash
bun run test:chat-history:all
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Unit tests
bun run test:unit:chat-history

# Integration tests  
bun run test:integration:chat-history

# E2E tests
bun run test:e2e:chat-history
```

## CI Integration

Tests are automatically run in GitHub Actions CI:

- **Unit Tests Job**: Runs `test:unit:chat-history`
- **Integration Tests Job**: Runs `test:integration:chat-history` (requires backend server)
- **E2E Tests Job**: Runs `test:e2e:chat-history` (requires backend server + Grid session)

All tests must pass before PRs can be merged.

## Test Patterns

### Integration Tests
- Use real Supabase connection
- Create test data in `beforeAll`
- Clean up test data in `afterAll`
- Test with real user sessions

### E2E Tests
- Simulate complete user journeys
- Test with real backend API
- Verify end-to-end flows
- Include error scenarios

### Edge Case Focus
- Empty states
- Error conditions
- Concurrent operations
- Large datasets
- Special characters
- Race conditions

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- **UI Tests (Playwright)**: Browser-based UI testing for chat history page interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with 1000+ conversations
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Mobile-specific Tests**: React Native specific behaviors

## Notes

- Unit tests focus on logic that can be tested without React hooks
- Integration tests use real Supabase but don't require backend server
- E2E tests require full backend server and Grid session
- All tests follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Tests are designed to be robust and catch edge cases
