# PR Review Fixes - OTP Flow Persistence

This document tracks the fixes for the two issues identified in the PR review by the Vercel bot.

## Issue 1: Chat Message Persistence ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** User messages were lost when Grid session expired during message sending, requiring OTP verification.

**Root Cause:** The infrastructure existed (`pendingMessage` and `clearPendingMessage` in `useChatState`) but wasn't wired up to the `ChatInput` component.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `chat.tsx` to extract `pendingMessage` and `clearPendingMessage` from `useChatState`
- Wired up these props to `ChatInput` component (lines 157-158)
- `ChatInput` already had the logic to handle these props, so no changes needed there

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/client/app/(main)/chat.tsx` - Added props to ChatInput

**How It Works:**
1. User types a message: "Show me SOL price"
2. Grid session expires when trying to send
3. `useChatState.handleSendMessage()` saves message to `pendingMessage` state
4. User redirected to OTP screen
5. After OTP completion, returns to chat
6. `ChatInput` receives `pendingMessage` prop and restores message to input field
7. User can edit or send the restored message
8. After sending, `onPendingMessageCleared()` clears the pending message

## Issue 2: Wallet Transaction Persistence ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Pending wallet transactions were lost when Grid session expired during send, requiring OTP verification.

**Root Cause:** The `pendingSend` state was stored only in component memory, not persisted across navigation. When `router.replace('/(main)/wallet')` was called after OTP completion, the component remounted with fresh state.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `useEffect` to restore `pendingSend` from `sessionStorage` on mount (lines 38-53)
- Modified `handleSendToken` to persist `pendingSend` to `sessionStorage` before OTP redirect (lines 108-115)
- Updated cleanup logic to remove from `sessionStorage` after transaction completes (lines 159-164)

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/client/app/(main)/wallet.tsx` - Added sessionStorage persistence

**How It Works:**
1. User initiates send: 0.5 SOL to address XYZ
2. Grid session expires when trying to send
3. `handleSendToken` saves transaction to `pendingSend` state AND `sessionStorage`
4. User redirected to OTP screen
5. After OTP completion, `router.replace` navigates back to wallet
6. Component remounts, `useEffect` restores `pendingSend` from `sessionStorage`
7. `useEffect([gridAccount, pendingSend])` detects restored transaction
8. Transaction executes automatically
9. After completion, clears both state and `sessionStorage`

## Testing

Both fixes are covered by comprehensive tests:

**Test File:** `__tests__/e2e/otp-flow-persistence.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Chat message saved when Grid session fails
- ✅ Chat message restored after OTP completion
- ✅ Chat message cleared after sending
- ✅ Transaction saved to sessionStorage
- ✅ Transaction restored from sessionStorage on mount
- ✅ Transaction cleared after completion
- ✅ Complete OTP flow scenarios for both features
- ✅ Edge cases (corrupted data, missing sessionStorage, multiple rapid triggers)

**Run Tests:**
```bash
# Run all persistence tests
bun run test:e2e:persistence

# Run all E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run full test suite
bun run test:all
```

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Fix 1: Chat message persistence - Code updated
- [x] Fix 1: Props wired up correctly
- [x] Fix 2: Wallet transaction persistence - Code updated
- [x] Fix 2: sessionStorage persistence added
- [x] Tests written for both fixes
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] npm scripts added for running tests

## Pattern Notes

Both fixes follow the same pattern established in `GridContext.tsx`:
- Use `sessionStorage` for persistence across navigation
- Check `typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.sessionStorage` before use
- Handle JSON parse errors gracefully
- Clear sessionStorage after action completes

This pattern ensures:
1. Data persists across component remounts
2. Works on web (our primary platform)
3. Degrades gracefully if sessionStorage unavailable
4. No data leakage (cleaned up after use)
5. Consistent with existing codebase patterns

## Review Comments

Both issues identified by the Vercel bot were valid and important UX problems. The fixes ensure:
- Users don't lose their typed messages during OTP flows
- Wallet transactions resume automatically after OTP completion
- Better user experience overall
- No surprising data loss
