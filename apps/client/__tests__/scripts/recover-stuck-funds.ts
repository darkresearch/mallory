/**
 * Recover Stuck Funds from Ephemeral Wallets
 * 
 * Sweeps funds from failed test runs back to Grid wallet
 * IMPORTANT: This requires the ephemeral wallet keypairs, which we don't have!
 * 
 * The funds are stuck because:
 * - Ephemeral wallets are generated randomly each test
 * - Private keys not saved (by design)
 * - Can't sign sweep transactions without keys
 * 
 * SOLUTION: Accept this as the cost of testing (~$0.30 total)
 * PREVENTION: Fix the sweep to work DURING the test, not after
