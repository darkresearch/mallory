# Test Infrastructure Status Report

## ✅ Completed Phases (1-6)

### Phase 1: Test Storage ✅
- Mock secure storage working perfectly
- Persists to `.test-secrets/test-storage.json`
- Validated with `validate-storage.ts`

### Phase 2: Mailosaur Integration ✅
- Successfully connects to Mailosaur API
- Retrieves OTP from email subject lines
- Validated with `validate-mailosaur.ts`

### Phase 3: Supabase Auth ✅
- Test user created: `mallory-testing@7kboxsdj.mailosaur.net`
- Email/password authentication working
- Auth tokens generated successfully
- Validated with `validate-auth.ts`

### Phase 4: Grid Account Creation ✅
- Grid account created successfully with OTP
- **AddressMenu`Cm3JboRankogPCAhHiin5msHjWmCD8sbNBxVwjBUa1Vz`
- Session secrets cached
- Validated with `validate-grid.ts`

### Phase 5: Grid Session Loading ✅
- Cached sessions load correctly
- Grid API balance calls work
- Wallet funded: 0.1 SOL + 5 USDC
- Validated with `validate-grid-load.ts`

### Phase 6: Conversation Creation ✅
- Conversations create in Supabase
- Each test gets unique conversation ID
- Validated with `validate-conversation.ts`

## 🚧 Current Blocker: Grid Token Transfers

### Issue
Grid SDK's `prepareArbitraryTransaction` fails with "Transaction simulation failed" when trying to send tokens.

### What We've Tried
1. ✅ Simple payload format: `{ type: 'spl_transfer', ... }` → "Payload is required for signing"
2. ✅ Arbitrary transaction with fee config → "Transaction simulation failed"
3. ✅ Spending limit approach → "spending limit must have at least one signer"

### Root Cause
Unclear if this is:
- Grid SDK version issue
- Transaction format issue
- Production code issue (maybe sendTokens never worked?)
- Grid account configuration issue

### Next Steps
**Option A**: Debug Grid transfers (time-consuming, may be SDK bug)
**Option B**: Pivot to testing with mocked payments (test everything else)
**Option C**: Use direct Solana transfers (bypass Grid for ephemeral funding)

## 📊 What We CAN Test Right Now

Without Grid token transfers working, we can still test:

1. ✅ Authentication flow
2. ✅ Grid account management
3. ✅ Conversation creation
4. ✅ Chat API calls
5. ⏸️ Stream parsing (Phase 7)
6. ⏸️ Payment detection (Phase 8)
7. 🚧 X402 payment (Phase 9 - blocked on Grid transfers)
8. ⏸️ Full E2E (Phase 10 - can mock payment)

---

## 💡 Recommended Path Forward

### Short-term: Test with Mocked Payments

Create tests that:
1. Call chat API
2. Detect payment requirements
3. **Mock** the X402 payment execution
4. Validate the rest of the flow

This tests 80% of the system and unblocks progress.

### Long-term: Fix Grid Transfers

Separately investigate:
1. Is production Mallory sendTokens working?
2. Check Grid SDK version
3. Contact Grid support if needed
4. Document workaround
