# Mallory Client

> **Opinionated** React Native crypto x AI chat app boilerplate with embedded wallet support, conversational AI, and dynamic UI component injection

**üì¶ Part of the Mallory Monorepo** - See [root README](../../README.md) for complete documentation.

Mallory is a production-ready, full-stack mobile boilerplate for building AI-powered chat applications with native cryptocurrency wallet integration. Built for developers who want to ship fast without sacrificing quality or making endless architectural decisions.

## üèóÔ∏è Monorepo Structure

This is the client app within the Mallory monorepo:
- `apps/client/` (this directory) - React Native app
- `apps/server/` - Backend API server
- `packages/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types

See [../../README.md](../../README.md) for the complete getting started guide.

## What Makes Mallory Different?

Mallory solves the hard problems for modern applications, combining the latest scaffolding in crypto, AI, and mobile:

- ‚úÖ **Embedded wallets that actually work** - Grid integration with KYC flows, not just "install MetaMask"
- ‚úÖ **Streaming AI that feels native** - Token-by-token updates, not janky text replacements
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic UI components** - LLMs inject charts, citations, and custom elements inline
- ‚úÖ **AI tool visualization** - Chain of thought shows when backend calls tools (search, data APIs, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **x402 payment compatible** - Works with backends that implement autonomous payment protocol
- ‚úÖ **Security by default** - Server-side Supabase access, proper token validation, RLS policies
- ‚úÖ **Production-grade state management** - Real-time subscriptions, optimistic updates, error boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Actually cross-platform** - Native iOS/Android + Web, not "mobile-first with web hacks"

**This is the boilerplate we built for [Dark's](https://darkresearch.ai) Scout**, our upcoming consumer finance app. Now it's yours.

## Quick Start

**Note:** Run these commands from the monorepo root, not this directory.

```bash
# From monorepo root
bun install

# Configure client
cp apps/client/.env.example apps/client/.env
# Edit apps/client/.env with your credentials

# Run client (web)
bun run client

# Or run from this directory
cd apps/client
bun run web
```

**Backend:** The Mallory server is in `apps/server/`. See [Backend Setup](../../README.md#server-development).

---

## Why Mallory is Opinionated

Every dependency was selected for a reason:

### **Embedded Wallet Infrastructure: [Squads Grid](https://www.squads.so/grid)**
- Non-custodial Solana wallets managed via API
- **Client-side signing**: Session secrets never leave the device
- No private key management complexity
- Built-in email-based auth with OTP
- Production-ready transaction signing
- **Why Grid?** An enterprise-grade embedded wallet solution that doesn't require you to become a custodian, with all signing happening securely on the client.

### **Backend-as-a-Service: [Supabase](https://supabase.com)**
- PostgreSQL database with automatic APIs
- Built-in authentication with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Realtime subscriptions for live chat updates
- Edge functions for serverless logic
- **Why Supabase?** Open-source, self-hostable, and replaces 5+ separate services

### **AI Streaming: [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai)**
- Framework-agnostic streaming chat (powered by [StreamdownRN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamdown-rn))
- Built-in React hooks (`useChat`, streaming state)
- Supports tool calling and dynamic UI
- Works with any LLM provider
- **Why Vercel AI SDK?** Best-in-class developer experience for streaming AI responses

### **Cross-Platform: [Expo](https://expo.dev)**
- Single codebase for iOS, Android, and Web
- Native performance with managed workflow
- Over-the-air updates
- Cloud builds (no need for Xcode/Android Studio)
- **Why Expo?** The modern way to build React Native apps

### **Markdown Rendering: [StreamdownRN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamdown-rn)**
- Mobile-compatible port of [Vercel's streamdown](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/streamdown) (built by Dark)
- Streaming markdown parser for React Native
- Dynamic component injection from LLM responses
- Syntax highlighting, math equations, tables
- **Why StreamdownRN?** Vercel's streamdown is web-only. We ported it to React Native with native optimizations

### **x402 Payment Protocol (Backend Feature)**
When connected to an x402-enabled backend, Mallory visualizes autonomous AI payments:
- Backend implements [x402 protocol](https://x402.org) for micropayments
- AI agents pay for premium APIs (Nansen, Dune, etc.) automatically
- Client displays payment activity in Chain of Thought UI
- Uses Grid wallet for sub-cent USDC payments on Solana
- **Why x402?** Unlocks premium data sources without manual payment UX

**Note:** x402 implementation lives on the backend for security. Mallory provides the UI to display tool usage and payment activity.

- Bun for 3-10x faster installs
- Hot reload that actually works
- Component registry unit tests

## Architectural Principles

Mallory follows specific design principles that make it production-ready:

### **1. Server-Side Security**
- All Supabase access uses **service role keys on the backend**
- Client never gets direct database access (RLS as defense-in-depth only)
- API endpoints validate tokens and enforce authorization
- **Why?** Client-side security is an illusion; real security lives on the server

### **2. Streaming-First AI**
- All AI responses stream token-by-token
- UI updates in real-time as responses arrive
- Uses Vercel AI SDK's React hooks (`useChat`)
- **Why?** Streaming is table stakes for modern AI UX

### **3. Component Registry for Dynamic UI**
- LLMs can inject typed components into markdown responses
- `<Citation>`, `<PriceChart>`, `<TokenCard>`, etc.
- Type-safe with JSON schema validation
- **Why?** Text-only AI responses are limiting; dynamic UI unlocks new possibilities

### **4. Feature-Module Architecture**
- Each feature (`auth`, `chat`, `wallet`) is self-contained
- Features export clean service APIs
- Hooks encapsulate feature logic
- **Why?** Makes the codebase maintainable and testable

### **5. Mobile-First, Web-Compatible**
- Designed for native mobile performance
- Web is a first-class citizen (not an afterthought)
- Platform-specific optimizations where needed
- **Why?** Most crypto users are on mobile; distribution needs web

### Notable Choices

**Why Bun?** 3-10x faster than npm, native TypeScript support, workspace management.

**Why Context over Redux/Zustand?** Simpler API, built-in, sufficient for this scope. Upgrade if you need time-travel debugging.

**Why Expo Router?** Type-safe, file-based routing. Feels like Next.js for mobile.

**Why @ai-sdk over LangChain?** Lighter weight, better streaming support, framework-agnostic.

**Why streamdown-rn?** Vercel's [streamdown](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/streamdown) is excellent but web-only. We ported it to React Native with optimizations for mobile rendering, touch interactions, and native clipboard support. Open sourced at [npmjs.com/package/streamdown-rn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamdown-rn).

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                   # Utility libraries
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### **Component Registry System**
Dynamic, type-safe components that LLMs can inject into responses:

```typescript
// LLM outputs markdown with components
<Citation url="https://..." title="Research paper" />

// Registry validates and renders
<InlineCitation url="https://..." title="Research paper" />
```

See `components/registry/README.md` for the full component catalog.

#### **Feature Module Pattern**
Each feature is self-contained with clean boundaries:

```
features/wallet/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts              # Public API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                # React hooks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/             # Business logic
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solana.ts         # Blockchain interactions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grid-api.ts       # Grid wallet API
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.ts           # Data fetching
```

Import via feature index: `import { walletService } from '@/features/wallet'`

#### **Authentication Flow**
- **Web**: Supabase OAuth (redirects to Google)
- **Mobile**: Native Google Sign-In SDK (better UX)
- **Backend**: Validates Supabase tokens, enforces RLS
- **Unified**: Same session tokens work across all platforms

#### **Real-Time Updates**
Supabase realtime subscriptions for:
- New messages in conversations
- Wallet balance changes
- Transaction confirmations

#### **Grid Wallet Integration**
- Embedded Solana wallets (no seed phrases for users)
- KYC verification flow (OTP-based)
- Backend proxies all Grid API calls
- Transaction signing via Grid API

## Deployment

### Native Builds

The native `ios/` and `android/` folders are not included in the repository. Generate them first:

```bash
# Generate native folders from app.config.js
bun expo prebuild

# iOS: Install CocoaPods dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Build for iOS
bun run build:ios

# Build for Android
bun run build:android
```

**Note:** The prebuild command uses your `app.config.js` settings to generate properly configured native projects with your app name, bundle ID, and branding.

### Web Deployment

Build for web production:

```bash
bun run web:export
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### EAS Build (Recommended)

For managed cloud builds via Expo Application Services (no local Xcode/Android Studio needed):

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
bun add -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS (generates eas.json if needed)
eas build:configure

# Build for production
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android

# Or build both at once
eas build --platform all
```

**Benefits:**
- No need for local Xcode or Android Studio
- Builds in the cloud
- Automatic code signing
- Perfect for CI/CD
