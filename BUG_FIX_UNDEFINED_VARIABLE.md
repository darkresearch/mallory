# üêõ Bug Fix: Undefined Variable in useConversationLoader

## Issue Found by Review Bot

**File**: `apps/client/hooks/useConversationLoader.ts`  
**Line**: 32  
**Problem**: Reference to undefined variable `CURRENT_CONVERSATION_KEY`

---

## Root Cause

During the storage key refactoring, I removed the local constant:
```typescript
const CURRENT_CONVERSATION_KEY = 'current_conversation_id'; // ‚ùå Removed
```

But I missed updating **one reference** on line 32:
```typescript
await secureStorage.setItem(CURRENT_CONVERSATION_KEY, conversationIdParam); // ‚ùå Undefined!
```

This would cause a **ReferenceError** at runtime when a user opens a specific conversation from history.

---

## Fix Applied

**Before:**
```typescript
await secureStorage.setItem(CURRENT_CONVERSATION_KEY, conversationIdParam);
```

**After:**
```typescript
await secureStorage.setItem(SECURE_STORAGE_KEYS.CURRENT_CONVERSATION_ID, conversationIdParam);
```

---

## Why It Was Missed

My earlier fix only updated the import statement:
```typescript
import { secureStorage, SECURE_STORAGE_KEYS } from '../lib';
```

But I failed to update the **usage** on line 32. This is exactly why the storage key consistency test is valuable!

---

## Verification

‚úÖ No more undefined `CURRENT_CONVERSATION_KEY` references  
‚úÖ All storage operations now use centralized constants  
‚úÖ The storage key consistency CI test will catch similar issues in the future

---

## Impact

**Without this fix:**
- User clicks on conversation in history
- Code tries to save current conversation ID
- **ReferenceError: CURRENT_CONVERSATION_KEY is not defined**
- Conversation navigation breaks

**With this fix:**
- User clicks on conversation in history
- Code uses `SECURE_STORAGE_KEYS.CURRENT_CONVERSATION_ID`
- Works correctly ‚úÖ

## Lessons Learned

This demonstrates why:
1. ‚úÖ Automated code review bots are valuable
2. ‚úÖ CI tests for storage keys are essential
3. ‚úÖ Global find/replace can miss scope-specific issues
4. ‚úÖ Testing actual code paths catches what static analysis misses

The CI test I added (`storage-key-consistency.test.ts`) would have caught this if it ran on the code before this fix!
