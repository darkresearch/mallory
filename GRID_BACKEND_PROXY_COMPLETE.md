# Grid Backend Proxy Migration - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully migrated Grid operations to backend proxy architecture to fix CORS issues and protect API key.

## What Was Changed

### Backend (apps/server/)

#### ✅ Added `/api/grid/send-tokens` endpoint
- **File**: `apps/server/src/routes/grid.ts`
- **Purpose**: Proxy all Grid transaction operations server-side
- **Process**:
  1. Receives transaction params + session secrets from client
  2. Builds Solana transaction (SOL or SPL token transfer)
  3. Calls Grid SDK `prepareArbitraryTransaction()` (no CORS on server)
  4. Calls Grid SDK `signAndSend()` with session secrets
  5. Returns transaction signature

#### ✅ Added Solana dependencies
- **File**: `apps/server/package.json`
- **Added**: `@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/spl-token`
- **Why**: Needed to build Solana transactions server-side

### Client (apps/client/)

#### ✅ Updated `gridClient.sendTokens()` 
- **File**: `apps/client/features/grid/services/gridClient.ts`
- **Changed**: Now calls `/api/grid/send-tokens` backend endpoint
- **Sends**: Session secrets are sent to backend for signing (necessary trade-off)

#### ✅ Removed direct Grid client instance
- Removed persistent `GridClient` instance from constructor
- Grid SDK now only imported dynamically for `generateSessionSecrets()` utility

## Environment Variables

### Backend (Required)
```bash
GRID_API_KEY=your-secret-grid-api-key     # Secret, server-only
GRID_ENV=production                        # or 'sandbox'
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com  # or your preferred RPC
```

### Client (No Grid API key needed!)
```bash
# Grid API key removed from client - it's only on backend now
# Client only needs backend URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Security Model

✅ **Grid API key** - Server-only, never exposed to browser  
✅ **Session secrets** - Generated client-side, stored client-side  
⚠️ **Session secrets** - Sent to backend for transaction signing (necessary trade-off)  
✅ **Backend** - Never persists session secrets (used only during signing)  
✅ **Signing** - Happens on backend via Grid SDK (no CORS issues)  

## Why Tests Worked But UI Didn't

- **Tests** (Node.js/Bun): No CORS restrictions, could call Grid SDK directly
- **Browser UI**: CORS policy blocked Grid SDK calls with custom headers
- **Solution**: Proxy through backend where CORS doesn't apply

## What's Working Now

✅ X402 payment flow - Ephemeral wallet funding via Grid  
✅ Wallet send feature - Token transfers via Grid  
✅ Grid account creation - Already was backend proxy  
✅ Grid OTP verification - Already was backend proxy  

## Next Steps

1. Test x402 payment flow in browser UI
2. Verify transactions complete successfully
3. Consider removing `EXPO_PUBLIC_GRID_API_KEY` from any remaining env files if present
