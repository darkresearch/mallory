6. **Auto-completion** - Seamless flow, no friction

---

## Complete User Experience

### First-Time Sign In

1. **User signs in** â†’ AuthContext checks `hasCompletedOnboarding = false`
2. **Loading screen** â†’ Creates onboarding conversation (`is_onboarding: true`)
3. **Chat opens** â†’ Empty conversation detected
4. **Placeholder appears instantly** â†’ Mallory "M" avatar with "Mallory wants to say hello"
5. **Greeting streams in**:
   - **"Hey there!"** in large, bold Belwe font (32pt) âœ¨
   - Rest of message in smooth typewriter (50 cps, subtle fade-in)
   - Includes wallet address, x402 explanation, funding instructions
6. **Completion** â†’ Server marks `has_completed_onboarding = true`
7. **User continues** â†’ Can chat normally in same conversation

### Subsequent Sign Ins

- User goes straight to chat (no onboarding)
- Normal "Thinking" indicator
- Regular font styling
- Standard typewriter effect

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database
- `users` table with `has_completed_onboarding BOOLEAN` column
- Auto-populated via trigger when users sign up
- Updated by server when onboarding completes

### Server-Side Features

**Onboarding Prompts** (`apps/server/prompts/onboarding.ts`)
- Confident, warm greeting with personality
- H1 markdown for first sentence: `# Hey there!`
- Wallet address template: `{WALLET_ADDRESS}`
- Clear funding requirements (SOL + USDC)
- Honest about "extra step" - very human

**Chat Route** (`apps/server/src/routes/chat/index.ts`)
- Detects `'onboarding_greeting'` system message
- Fetches conversation metadata (`is_onboarding: true`)
- Injects onboarding prompts with wallet address
- Adds synthetic user message to prevent empty array
- Passes original messages (no synthetic) to client

**Auto-Completion** (`apps/server/src/routes/chat/config/streamResponse.ts`)
- Marks `has_completed_onboarding = true` in `onFinish` callback
- Only for onboarding conversations
- Happens automatically after first AI message

### Client-Side Features

**Routing** (`apps/client/app/(main)/loading.tsx`)
- Checks `user.hasCompletedOnboarding`
- Creates onboarding conversation if false
- Redirects to chat

**Onboarding Detection** (`apps/client/hooks/useChatState.ts`)
- Checks conversation for `is_onboarding` metadata
- Sets `isOnboardingGreeting = true`
- Triggers placeholder immediately
- Sends system message to trigger greeting
- Clears flag when complete

**Custom Styling** (`apps/client/components/chat/`)
- MessageList detects first message + onboarding flag
- Passes `thinkingText` and `isOnboardingMessage`
- SimpleMessageRenderer creates H1 styleOverrides:
  ```typescript
  {
    heading1: {
      fontFamily: 'Belwe-Bold',
      fontSize: 32,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      color: '#1a1a1a',
      marginTop: 0,
      marginBottom: 12,
    }
  }
  ```
- AssistantResponse passes to StreamdownRN

### StreamdownRN Enhancements (v0.1.4-beta.2)

**Style Overrides**
- Generic `styleOverrides` prop
- Deep merge with base theme
- Per-instance customization
- Keeps package app-agnostic

**Typewriter Effect**
- `TypewriterText` component for smooth reveal
- 50 characters per second (medium speed)
- 100ms fade-in (subtle)
- Character-by-character display
- requestAnimationFrame for 60fps
- Works with streaming updates

## Testing the Complete Experience

### Setup
1. Ensure `has_completed_onboarding` column exists in users table
2. Start Mallory server: `bun run dev` (from monorepo root)
3. Start Mallory client: `bun run web` (from apps/client)

### Test New User Flow

1. **Sign in with new account**
   - Should redirect to chat automatically
   
2. **Observe onboarding greeting:**
   - âœ… Mallory "M" placeholder appears instantly
   - âœ… Shows "Mallory wants to say hello" (not "Thinking")
   - âœ… "Hey there!" appears in large Belwe-Bold font (32pt)
   - âœ… Text reveals smoothly, character-by-character
   - âœ… Subtle fade-in on new characters
   - âœ… Includes wallet address in message
   - âœ… Explains x402 and funding clearly
   
3. **After greeting completes:**
   - âœ… Database updated: `has_completed_onboarding = true`
   - âœ… Can continue chatting in same conversation
   - âœ… Can start new conversations
   
4. **Send second message:**
   - âœ… Shows normal "Thinking" indicator
   - âœ… Uses regular fonts (no Belwe-Bold)
   - âœ… Still has smooth typewriter effect
   
5. **Sign out and back in:**
   - âœ… Goes directly to chat (skips onboarding)
   - âœ… No onboarding conversation created

### Visual Checklist

- [ ] Large "Hey there!" in Belwe-Bold
- [ ] Smooth character reveal (not jumpy)
- [ ] Subtle fade-in on characters
- [ ] Wallet address clearly visible
- [ ] "Mallory wants to say hello" shown
- [ ] Placeholder appears instantly (no blank screen)

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Character-by-Character?
Creates the most polished, premium feel. Each character appearing smoothly makes the AI feel more thoughtful and deliberate.

### Why 50 CPS?
Medium speed balances:
- Fast enough to not feel slow
- Slow enough to create smooth effect
- Readable as it appears
- Natural conversation pacing

### Why 100ms Fade?
Very subtle - just enough to soften the appearance without drawing attention to the animation itself. Feels natural, not gimmicky.

### Why Always On?
Consistent experience across all messages. User learns to expect the smooth reveal. Creates brand identity.

### Why Separate H1 Styling?
Makes the first impression memorable. The large, special font creates visual hierarchy and emotional impact.

---

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Pause briefly on punctuation (like ChatGPT)
- Speed up when far behind streaming input
- Slow down for emphasis words
- Skip typewriter on code blocks (instant display)
- User preference to disable typewriter
- Different speeds for different message types

---

## Notes for Developers

### Reusing in Other Apps

StreamdownRN's typewriter is fully generic. To use in other apps:

```typescript
import { StreamdownRN } from 'streamdown-rn';

<StreamdownRN 
  typewriter={true}  // Enable with defaults
  theme="light"
>
  {streamingText}
</StreamdownRN>
```

Or customize:

```typescript
<StreamdownRN 
  typewriter={{
    enabled: true,
    speed: 80,           // Your speed
    fadeInDuration: 150, // Your fade duration
    minChunkSize: 1,     // Chars per reveal
  }}
  theme="light"
>
  {streamingText}
</StreamdownRN>
```

### Performance

- Runs on requestAnimationFrame (60fps)
- No blocking operations
- Memory efficient (single state variable)
- Works smoothly on mobile and web
- Tested with long streaming responses

## Conclusion

The onboarding experience now provides a magical first impression:
- **Instant feedback** - No blank screens
- **Personal touch** - "wants to say hello"
- **Visual impact** - Large Belwe-Bold greeting
- **Smooth polish** - Typewriter effect throughout
- **Clear guidance** - Wallet funding explained
- **Frictionless** - Auto-completes, user continues chatting

Ready to test! ðŸš€
