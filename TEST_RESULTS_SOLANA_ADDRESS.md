## Key Findings

### 1. AI is Correctly Detecting Solana Addresses
The Claude AI model is successfully:
- Recognizing the 44-character base58 Solana address format
- Choosing `chain="solana"` parameter when calling Nansen tools
- Getting successful 200 responses from the Nansen API

### 2. Backend X402 Payment Flow Working
All tests confirm that:
- Server-side x402 payments are being processed successfully
- The Grid wallet integration is functioning
- Nansen API is returning valid data for Solana addresses

### 3. Production Errors Were Likely Transient
Since the tests cannot replicate the 422/404 errors, possible causes include:
- **Temporary Nansen API outage** - The Corbits/Nansen proxy may have been down
- **AI context issue** - The AI might have chosen `chain="ethereum"` in production (incorrect)
- **Network/timeout issue** - Connection problems during the x402 payment flow
- **Rate limiting** - Too many requests in a short time period

## Analysis

### Tool Configuration
All Nansen tools have:
- `chain` parameter with `.default('ethereum')` 
- Description: "Supports: Ethereum, Solana, and other major chains"
- **No explicit Solana address detection logic in the tools themselves**

The AI must infer from the address format which chain to use.

### Request Format (from NansenUtils)
```typescript
// Current Balance Request
formatCurrentBalanceRequest(params: { address: string; chain?: string }): {
  wallet_address: params.address,
  chain: params.chain || 'ethereum'
}
```

The Nansen API expects:
- `wallet_address`: The address to query
- `chain`: Must be "solana" for Solana addresses

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep As-Is (Rely on AI)
**Pros:**
- Currently working in tests
- Keeps tools flexible
- AI is smart enough to detect address formats

**Cons:**
- Relies on AI inference (not guaranteed)
- Production errors suggest it failed in some cases
- No fallback if AI chooses wrong chain

### Option 2: Add Address Format Detection
Add server-side validation to auto-detect and override chain parameter:

```typescript
function detectChain(address: string): string {
  // Ethereum: 0x followed by 40 hex chars
  if (/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/.test(address)) return 'ethereum';
  
  // Solana: 32-44 base58 chars (typically 44)
  if (/^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,44}$/.test(address)) return 'solana';
  
  // ENS/other
  return 'ethereum'; // default
}
```

Then in tool execution:
```typescript
execute: async ({ address, chain }: { address: string; chain: string }) => {
  const detectedChain = detectChain(address);
  const finalChain = detectedChain || chain; // Use detected over AI's choice
  // ...
}
```

### Option 3: Enhance System Prompt
Add explicit instruction to system prompt:
```
**IMPORTANT - Address Chain Detection:**
When using Nansen tools, ALWAYS detect the blockchain from address format:
- Ethereum addresses: Start with "0x", 42 characters (e.g., 0xd8dA6BF2...)
- Solana addresses: 32-44 base58 characters, no "0x" (e.g., AWgfUQi2Z4HFbn...)
- ENS names: End with ".eth"

Set the "chain" parameter accordingly:
- Ethereum addresses → chain="ethereum"  
- Solana addresses → chain="solana"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate production logs** - Check server logs from the time of the 422/404 errors to see:
   - What chain parameter was sent
   - What the actual API request looked like
   - The full error response from Nansen API

2. **Add logging** - Enhance server logging to capture:
   - Chain parameter chosen by AI
   - Request body sent to Nansen
   - Response status and error details

3. **Decide on approach** - Choose one of the recommendations above

4. **Monitor production** - Watch for any future occurrences of the error

## Test Files Modified

- `apps/client/__tests__/e2e/x402-nansen-current-balance.test.ts`
- `apps/client/__tests__/e2e/x402-nansen-labels.test.ts`
- `apps/client/__tests__/e2e/x402-nansen-transactions.test.ts`
- `apps/client/__tests__/e2e/x402-nansen-pnl-summary.test.ts`

Each file now has two tests:
1. Original test with Ethereum address/ENS
2. New test with Solana address `AWgfUQi2Z4HFbn7FtcqBc7UjZAF9H7HqYwnYBJbFbZ1p`
