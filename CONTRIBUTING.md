# Contributing to Mallory

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mallory! This guide will help you get started.

## 🏗️ Monorepo Structure

Mallory is organized as a Bun workspace monorepo:

```
mallory/
├── apps/
│   ├── client/          # React Native app
│   └── server/          # Backend API
├── packages/
│   └── shared/          # Shared TypeScript types
└── package.json         # Workspace config
```

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Git
- For native development: Xcode (iOS) or Android Studio (Android)

### Installation

cp apps/client/.env.example apps/client/.env
# Edit apps/client/.env with your credentials

# Server
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
# Edit apps/server/.env with your API keys
```

4. **Start development servers:**
```bash
# Both client and server
bun run dev

# Or separately
bun run client  # Client web dev server
bun run server  # Backend API server
```

## 📝 Making Changes

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code conventions
- Run type checking before committing: `bun run type-check`

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Update documentation
refactor: Refactor code
test: Add tests
chore: Update dependencies
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes

## 🔍 Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes:**
- Write clear, concise code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes:**
```bash
# Type check
cd apps/client && bun run type-check
cd apps/server && bun run type-check

# Test client (web)
cd apps/client && bun run web

# Test server
cd apps/server && bun run dev
```

4. **Commit and push:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

5. **Open pull request:**
- Clear description of changes
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots for UI changes
